#Student Grade Checker

##Description
This project allows users to input a student's name and score, and it determines their grade using JavaScript's `if` statement. The grade is displayed dynamically on the web page.

## Features
- Uses `if` statements for conditional logic.
- Includes variables, arrays, and objects for data handling.
- Demonstrates DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Styled with basic CSS.

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a student's name and score (0-100).
3. Click the "Check Grade" button to see the result.

## Files
- `index.html`: HTML structure.
- `style.css`: Styles the web page.
- `script.js`: Contains JavaScript logic.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a reset button to clear inputs.
- Store student data in an array or object for further analysis.
